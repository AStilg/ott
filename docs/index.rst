Welcome to the OTT documentation!
=================================

This documentation has information about using the optical tweezers
toolbox for
calculating optical forces and torques; as well as documentation on how
you can extend the toolbox to include your own types of beams or
particles. The documentation is split into 3 main parts: `Getting
Started <Getting-Started>`__, `Examples <Examples>`__ and
`Reference <Reference>`__. The Reference section contains information
about the functions and classes included in the toolbox. For a list of
papers describing the toolbox and further reading, see the `Further
Reading <Further-Reading>`__ page.
