ott - Optical Tweezers Toolbox
==============================

The optical tweezers toolbox can be used to calculate optical forces
and torques of particles using the T-matrix formalism in a vector
spherical wave basis.
The toolbox includes codes for calculating T-matrices, beams described
by vector spherical wave functions, functions for calculating forces
and torques, and examples.

Installation
------------

To use the toolbox, download or clone the GitHub repository.
This version of the toolbox is released as a package, `+ott`, which
contains a collection of functions for calculating T-matricies, beam
coefficients, force and torques.
To use the functions in your code, the easiest way is to add the
directory containing the package to your path and importing the package,

```matlab
addpath('<download-path>/ott');
import ott.*
```

if you regularly use the toolbox you might want to add the command to
your [startup.m](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html?searchHighlight=startup.m) file.
You might also want to add the examples to your path

```matlab
addpath('<download-path>/ott/examples');
```

Getting started
---------------

1. To get started using the toolbox you should first take a look at the
users guide for version 1.2 and the optical tweezers computational
toolbox paper (pre-print).  Both are available on our
[website](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/TimoNieminen/software.html).

2. Copy the examples to your working directory, and play with
    them. Start with example_gaussian.m.

3. It's best to use length units of the wavelength in the trapping
    medium, usually free-space wavelength/1.33.
    
4. The examples calculate the force and torque efficiencies. These are
    the force and torque per photon, in photon units. To convert to
    SI units:
                force_SI = force_Q * n * P/c
               torque_SI = torque_Q * P/w
    where n is the refractive index of the surrounding medium,
          P is the beam power in watts,
          c is the speed of light in free space,
          w is the angular optical frequency, in radians/s.

Upgrading
---------

* Download the latest release of 1.3, add it to your Matlab path with

```
addpath('ott-1.3/ott-toolbox');
```

* Make sure change warnings are on, i.e. add the following to your code:

```
ott_warning('once');
change_warnings('on');
```

* Run your code and take note of the warnings produced
* Download the latest release of 1.4.  Remove 1.3 from your matlab path
  and add 1.4 to your matlab path.

```
rmpath('ott-1.3/ott-toolbox');
addpath('ott-1.4/ott-toolbox');
```

* Turn off change warnings, since these are now the warnings about
  depreciations/changes to 1.5.

```
ott_warning('off');
ott_warning('on');
ott_warning('once');
change_warnings('off');
```

* For each of the warnings that you noted before when you ran your
  code for 1.3, change the appropriate lines.

  Common changes include:

  > `lg_mode_w0` is now depreciated.  If you are using the output of
    `lg_mode_w0` as input to the `bsc_*` functions, you should now pass
    the `beam_angle` into these functions instead of `w0`.

  > `z_rotation_matrix` can be replaced with `rotz(phi_deg)*roty(theta_deg)`
    where `phi_deg` and `theta_deg` are the azimuthal and axial
    rotations in degrees.

  > There is now only one force/torque calculation function, `forcetorque`.

  > `calc_rotation_matrix` can be replaced with `rotation_matrix`.

* Run your code again, checking the result is correct.

Upcoming release
----------------

* Version 1.5 will introduce an object orientated interface for
  beams and T-matrices.  Nmax will be hidden within the objects,
  and automatic choice of Nmax will be done where possible.

* Version 2 will introduces a focus on simulating particles in
  optical traps rather than just focussing on calculating optical
  forces and torques.  The plan is also to introduce geometric
  optics, Rayleigh particles, and arbitrary T-matrix particles
  calculated using DDA.  The toolbox will be more automated and
  include a graphical user interface.
